This figure shows the cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the Northern High Latitude Region for the year 2024. It is produced with an ecosystem model driven by near real time remote sensing and meteorological data. Points show monitoring sites used for calibration and validation.

![NEON_NEE_ytd_plot](/NEON_NEE_ytd_plot.png){: width="900" }

This figure is created with the latest eddy covariance data retrieved from the high latitude NEON sites.
The solid black line shows the cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the current year to the present date with 1 day latency. The grey shading and dotted line shows the seasonal average of all previous years.

This figure is created with the latest eddy covariance data retrieved from the high latitude ICOS sites.
The solid black line shows the cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the current year to the present date with 1 day latency. The grey shading and dotted line shows the seasonal average of all previous years.

![FPAR_ytd_plot](/FPAR_ytd_plot.png){: width="600" }

This figure is created with the latest satellite retrieval for the Eight Mile Lake site in Alaska.
It shows the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green leaves (FPAR) data product.
The grey shading and dotted line shows the 2002-present seasonal average while the solid black line and points show the current year's valid data.
